## Project Description
Discuss the details of project overview. Description your selected dataset, such as data source, number of variables, size of dataset, etc. Include data dictionary, if available.  Provide questions and hypothesis that you are exploring. What specific data analysis, visualization, and modeling work are you using to solve the problem? What roadblocks and challenges are you facing? etc. 

About Dataset  
The MNIST dataset is one of the best known image classification problems out there, and a veritable classic of the field of machine learning. This dataset is more challenging version of the same root problem: classifying letters from images. This is a multiclass classification dataset of glyphs of English letters A - J.

notMNIST_large.zip is a large but dirty version of the dataset with 529,119 images, and notMNIST_small.zip is a small hand-cleaned version of the dataset, with 18726 images. The dataset was assembled by Yaroslav Bulatov, and can be obtained on his [blog](https://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html). According to this blog entry there is about a 6.5% label error rate on the large uncleaned dataset, and a 0.5% label error rate on the small hand-cleaned dataset.

The two files each containing 28x28 grayscale images of letters A - J, organized into directories by letter. notMNIST_large.zip contains 529,119 images and notMNIST_small.zip contains 18726 images.
